# Loan Default Probability 📊

## Project Overview 🌟
The "Loan Default Probability" project 🏦 aims to predict the likelihood of loan defaults using machine learning techniques. This project consists of two main components:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the dataset to understand its characteristics and underlying patterns 📈.
2. **Predictive Modeling**: Developing a machine learning model to predict the probability of loan defaults 🔍.

## Data 📁
The project utilizes two datasets:
- `train.csv`: The training dataset containing various features and the target variable indicating loan defaults 📚.
- `test.csv`: The testing dataset used to evaluate the model's performance 📋.

## Technologies Used 💻
- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis and modeling 🐍.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis 📊.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization 🎨.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms and preprocessing techniques 🛠️.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🧐
The EDA notebook, `Ali Yusifov EDA.ipynb`, involves:
- Data loading and preprocessing 🔍.
- Statistical analysis of the data 📊.
- Visualization of data distributions and relationships between variables 📈.
- Identification of outliers using the Isolation Forest algorithm 🌳.
- Handling missing data with imputation techniques 💧.

## Predictive Modeling 🔮
The predictive modeling notebook, `Ali Yusifov Project.ipynb`, includes:
- Feature selection and preprocessing 🔧.
- Imputation of missing values using the Simple Imputer method 🔄.
- Application of various machine learning algorithms to train the predictive model 📚.
- Evaluation of the model's performance on the test dataset 📉.

## Installation and Usage 💾
To run the notebooks, ensure that you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn. Clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebooks in your preferred environment 🖥️.
